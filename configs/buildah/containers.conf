# Buildah Containers Configuration
# Location: /home/kimia/.config/containers/containers.conf
#
# This file configures the container engine behavior, including
# event logging, network backend, and available runtimes.

[engine]
# Event logging method
# "file" writes events to a log file
# Alternative: "journald" (requires systemd)
events_logger = "file"

# Network backend for container networking
# "netavark" is the modern CNI-based network backend
# Alternative: "cni" (legacy)
network_backend = "netavark"

# Available container runtimes
[engine.runtimes]
# runc - Standard OCI runtime (written in Go)
runc = ["/usr/bin/runc"]

# crun - Fast OCI runtime (written in C)
# crun is faster and uses less memory than runc
crun = ["/usr/bin/crun"]

# Default runtime (crun is used by default in Alpine)
# To change default, add: runtime = "runc"

# Notes:
# - crun is recommended for better performance
# - runc is more widely tested
# - Both are OCI-compliant and work identically
